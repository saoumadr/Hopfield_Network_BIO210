This public version does not provide the code as it is a reccurent course project given at EPFL.
Hopfield's Network.

The Hopfield network is a computational model for associative memory, proposed by John Hopfield in 1982. It models a simple mechanism to explain how a neural network could store representations (i.e. the neural activity corresponding to a certain concept) in the form of weighted connections between neurons.
In this project you will implement the iterative process which allows to retrieve one of the stored (memorized) patterns starting from the representation of a new (unseen) pattern.

## Results of the Experiments

You can access the detailed results of the experiments [here](./datas).
A summary resuming all the experiments done is available [here](https://github.com/EPFL-BIO-210/BIO-210-24-team-38/blob/main/summary.md).

## Credits

This project is realised by Three students in their second year at EFPL in the Life-Science section as part of the course
"Applied software engineering for life sciences" given by the teacher Alexander Mathis.
We were the group 38 and our teacher assistant was Wesley Elliott Stephen Monteith-Finas.
